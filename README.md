# Project 2 : booki-project

## About this project
This project is part of the OpenClassrooms web developer path :rocket:. This concerns the initial implementation of fundamental skills that need to be acquired to master the JavaScript language. The pages must generate data from the backend. A dynamic system for login, addition, and deletion of tasks needs to be created.
To launch the project and get the identification token, consult the README.md files in the frontend and backend folders.
